Refactored Pay Period Budgeting to mirror the monthly view structure. The pay period view now uses the same table structure, navigation patterns, and interactions as the monthly budget view, providing a consistent user experience. Key changes include:

- Created PayPeriodPicker component that mirrors MonthPicker functionality
- Created PayPeriodPageHeader component that mirrors BudgetPageHeader structure  
- Created PayPeriodBudgetTable component that mirrors BudgetTable structure
- Created PayPeriodSummary component for pay period-specific summary information
- Updated DynamicBudgetTable to conditionally render pay period or monthly view based on feature flag
- Maintained identical table structure with Budgeted, Spent, Balance, and Notes columns
- Preserved all existing interactions like category editing, reordering, and budget actions

This refactoring provides a foundation for Phase 4 of Pay Period Budgeting by eliminating the complexity of toggling between monthly and pay period views, while maintaining familiar UX patterns.
